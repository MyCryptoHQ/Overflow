## Running the App

This codebase targets Node 8.9.4 (LTS). After `npm install`ing all dependencies (You may be required to install additional system dependencies, due to some node modules relying on them) you can run various commands depending on what you want to do:

#### Development

```bash
# run app in dev mode in browser, rebuild on file changes
npm run start
```

#### Build Releases

```bash
# builds the production server app
npm run build
```
